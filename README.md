# ml_env_task
A task repo about using git and virtual environments.

## Goal
1. First, install anaconda/conda and then create a virtual environment to install all of your packages into.
2. Second, clone this repo onto your computer `git clone <press the green CODE button then copy the url here>`. 
3. Then, install the correct dependencies into the virtual environment and modify the versions/conda-channels to run the imports.py file successfully.
*You will need to use different conda channels for certain dependencies.*
4. Use the script `conda env export > env.yml` to save your current conda environment into a yml file.
